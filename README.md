# gpu_code
This is a not yet perfect version of orientation field code on gpu using opencl.
The simulation can be started by running unix.py
Depending on the parameter set the results of the simulations will be saved in the actual folder or there will be 
created as many new sub folders as many valeus the parameters have. 
The maggrad_ocl file written in Python is the host code
 and the kernel.cl is the kernel code.
